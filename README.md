# Ancillapp Backoffice

This backoffice allows to manage all the Ancillapp features (users, journals, 
songs, daily prayers, breviary, and holy masses) from a simple and intuitive interface.

Is can only be used by users that have a specific role assigned. Currently, it only 
supports the Superuser role, but more granular roles are expected to be implemented soon.
